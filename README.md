# My MTB Maps

Hello there.
You're probably visiting from my official website. Nice! 👍

This is my first [Svelte](https://kit.svelte.dev) project and I really enjoyed the DX and the outcome.
I'm sure to build more stuff with it in the future.

> If you clone this repository remember to change out the `GPX` & `GEOJSON` files that I statically generate
